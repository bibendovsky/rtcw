#BUG0001
========
Name:
    Level changing crash.

Victims:
   SP/ET(?)

Symptoms:
    Crash after finishing a level (for example "dam") when video resolution is
    too high (i.e. 1680x1050).
	
Reason:
    Backend data ("backEndData") used by drawing routines (for example,
"SCR_DrawScreenField" in cl_scrn.cpp) after "Hunk_Clear" (common.cpp) call.

Solution:
    Disable renderer command buffer between registration sequences.
Check for "tr.registered" in "R_GetCommandBuffer" ("tr_cmds.cpp") and return
"null" if the value if "false".

Additional information:
    This bug encountered only in compiled executables only.

#BUG0002
========
Name:
    C++ porting issues.

Victims:
    SP(mostly)/MP/ET

Symptoms:
    Scripted sequences (mostly in cutscenes) may behave incorrectly.

Reason:
    Call of a not appropriate overloaded math function.

Solution:
    a) Cast function's parameter to correct type.
    b) Make a set of wrappers for problematic functions with only
       one type of parameter(s).

Additional information.
    C++ provides overloaded versions for some functions (abs, fabs, etc.)
which can change a program's flow. For example, an "abs" function in C can
take only integral parameter, while C++ also supports float-point one.
