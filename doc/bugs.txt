#BUG0001
========
Name:
    Level changing crash.

Victims:
   SP/ET(?)

Symptoms:
    Crash after finishing a level (for example "dam") when video resolution is
    too high (i.e. 1680x1050).
	
Reason:
    Backend data ("backEndData") used by drawing routines (for example,
"SCR_DrawScreenField" in cl_scrn.cpp) after "Hunk_Clear" (common.cpp) call.

Solution:
    Disable renderer command buffer between registration sequences.
Check for "tr.registered" in "R_GetCommandBuffer" ("tr_cmds.cpp") and return
"null" if the value if "false".

Additional information:
    This bug encountered only in compiled executables only.
